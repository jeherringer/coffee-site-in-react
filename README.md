A fully functional React app with multiple pages. This website utilized a few technologies like create-react-app, Firebase, Express, React, webpack, Axiom, and some others. 

The first page is the landing page which contains a jumbotron and socials linked at the bottom:

At the top of the landing page is a horizontal navigation bar. Starting from the left and moving to the right: the contact page:

This contact page is integrated with Axiom to help deliver contact requests to both Firebase and a specified email, so everytime someone submits a contact request you can see what the message is and who it was from.

Next is the About page:

I just used random text for the paragraphs and need to replace the locally owned image with another random stock image as the currrent link is broken apparantly!

The next page is the locations page, which is integrated with Google Maps and Google Maps React to drop two markers where potential locations could be. Currently I am working on implementing information pop-ups on click as well once I figure the CORS issue I am running into! The navigation bar is still on this page, however I scrolled down to show the full location page content.

Lastly, there is the menu page. I created the menu myself in Adobe Photoshop and just threw on some coffee related products to include. While the full menu is not included in the screen shot you get an idea of the asthetic and feeling I went for regarding the menu.

As I continue to develop and work on this website, styles and animations will be included. I have run into a few road bumbs when it comes to deploying and I will be spending time to get it fully deployed and interactive!
